# Player Reviewer

## Features
This plugin allows users to apply for ranks, which are then rated by users with permissions to do so. The ratings are scored of 0-100 in criteria set within the config (custom criteria is limited to local file config at the moment, this will be updated to support SQL databases soon). An example of possible custom criteria is:

- Quality
- Size
- Creativity
- The default config options for local file configs are:

- Atmosphere
- Originality
- Terrain
- Structure
- Layout
The application logs the user's location and any user with permissions can teleport to the location to view a build relating to the application (for example). Another option is to log the location of the plot the user is currently in (Requires PlotSquared dependency).

When a staff member (with permissions to approve) has reviewed the application and the ratings given they can approve or deny, ultimately resulting in either the rank being granted or not.

The applications and ratings are logged either locally within the applications.yml file in the plugin folder or to a database, which can be configured within the applications.yml file too.

As it stands, currently the only permissions plugin supported are PermissionsEx and LuckPerms. Similarly, the only plot plugin supported at the moment is PlotSquared.
